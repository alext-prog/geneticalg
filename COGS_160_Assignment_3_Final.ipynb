    "# Particle Swarm Optimization \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The problem:\n",
    "In this assignment, we will be using the Particle Swarm algorithm to find the global minimum of a polynomial function. Particle Swarm Optimization is a biologically inspired algorithm that mimics a flock of birds or a school of fish. Similar to the Genetic Algorithm, PSO starts with a randomly created initial population, a set of possible solutions (called particles), and updates these particles after every iteration. However, GA uses crossover and mutation to create new individuals, whereas PSO maintains the same population but changes each particle over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided code stubs in this notebook to get you started, and give hints about the structure of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement Particle Swarm Optimization, and analyze the results. Then, you will qualitatively compare PSO to GA. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to submit a report along with the finished Jupyter notebook in which you should report the performance of the algorithm. The report instructions are in the bottom section of this notebook."

    "## Approach: \n",
    "Let's start with a few definitions. \n",
    "- Particle (aka \"individual\"): a solution to the polynomial function, which we are trying to minimize. It is specified by an $n$-dimensional vector where $n$ is the dimension of the polynomial ($n$ = 6 for this assignment). The particle's position in the swarm is defined to be this vector, which represents a possible solution to the problem. The particle also has a velocity vector, and variables that record the \"best\" (lowest) value found so far. \n",
    "- Population: a collection of possible solutions to the polynomial (i.e., a collection of Particles)\n",
    "- Fitness: a function that tells us how good each Particle is (in our case, how low of a value the Particle yields)\n",
    "-Best Value: another way to talk about the fitness; this is defined as the Particle's lowest value found so far, from plugging in a position into $f(\\overrightarrow{x})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Particle Swarm will proceed in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create the population (initialized with random positions and velocities)\n",
    "2. Initialize the global best value and all the Particles' individual best values. All best value initializations should be to $+\\infty$\n",
    "2. Update each Particle's individual best as well as the global best value found so far \n",
    "3. Update each Particle's velocity subject to the equation learned in class, and then update the Particle's position \n",
    "4. Update $w$\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 for 100 iterations\n",
    "6. Plot your results (best values)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm:\n",
    "At every iteration, the position of each Particle gets updated. Each Particle has a position vector, $x$, and a velocity vector, $v$. The velocity vector is changed, and then each element of the velocity vector gets added to each element of the position vector. The length of $x$ and $v$ is equal to dimension ($n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity vector is updated in the following way: \n",
    "\n",
    "$v_i^{t+1}$ = inertia + cognitive velocity + social velocity \n",
    "\n",
    "- inertia = $w$ * $v_i^{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "- cognitive velocity = $c_1$ * $r_1$ * (personal best position - current position)\n",
    "\n",
    "- social velocity = $c_2$ * $r_2$ * (global best position - current position)\n",
    "\n",
    "And the position vector is then updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_i^{t+1}$ = $x_i^{t}$ + $v_i^{t+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_1$ and $r_2$ are random numbers between 0 and 1, and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the cognitive and social parameters, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The direction that the particle will move in each iteration depends on these three vectors (inertia, cognitive velocity, social velocity). Cognitive velocity pushes the Particle towards its personal best, and social (global) velocity pushes the Particle towards the global best. \n",
